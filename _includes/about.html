  <p> I'm a data-driven professional combining a unique blend of analytical expertise from both business and academic contexts. With an MSci in Cognitive and Decision Sciences from UCL and a background in Human Sciences from Oxford, I bring a strong foundation in computational modeling, statistics, and human behavior analysis to the field of data science.</p>
  <p>In my roles leading People Operations and Talent Acquisition, I've consistently leveraged data analytics to drive decision-makingâ€”from developing predictive workforce models to conducting comprehensive analyses of hiring outcomes against performance metrics.</p>
  <p>Currently, I'm deepening my technical expertise through intensive study in Data Science and Machine Learning, including comprehensive coursework in Python, TensorFlow, SQL, and various ML frameworks. My academic projects have included developing a Prisoner's Dilemma game using Python and Django, and working with neural networks and computational modeling.</p>
  <p>I'm passionate about combining my understanding of human decision-making with technical data science skills to solve complex problems. My background in both people operations and cognitive science gives me a unique perspective on data analysis, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical solutions and human-centered outcomes.</p>
